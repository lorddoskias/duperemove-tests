There are some sample Duperemove v0.11 hashfiles. They are primarily
used for testing find-dupes via the --read-hashes switch.

The hashfiles are too large to store directly in git - you'll need to
install githubs open-source 'git-lfs' extension from
https://git-lfs.github.com/

You can then run 'git lfs checkout' to pull the files directly into
your checked out copy.

The data was generated via various runs of gen_mkzeros_test_data.sh so
keep in mind that it's unrealistically regular and tends towards just
having one large bucket of zero dupes. Still, it's been tremendously
helpful for doing timing tests of find-dupes changes.

File names are straightforward - #files_size.dup.

108_files_8G.dup.xz was heavily used for performance testing of the
find-dupes stage during v0.11.

The rest are incrementally smaller versions of a 500,000 file data set
I created for testing. We have many versions of this data so that it
can be tested on a wide variety of machines.
